 ## Tweaking autocomplete behavior

set completion-ignore-case On
set mark-directories On

  ## Setup some "ALT+" macros
  ## CTRL-e :: Bashism for "go to end of line"
  ## CTRL-u :: Bashism for "cut line after cursor to clipboard"
  ## \e :: used to map the escape key, also catches ALT key presses, more info: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/543341/34520
